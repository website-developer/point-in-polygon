Point in Polygon
================

This is a MySQL implementation of the point-in-polygon problem as described at http://web.archive.org/web/20120824103654/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_in_polygon

This implementation was inspired by http://web.archive.org/web/20120612132831/http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/geometry/insidepoly/

The "point_within_polygon" function seems to be at least 1.5 times faster than the "point_in_polygon" function.
